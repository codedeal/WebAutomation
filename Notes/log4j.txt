Log4j is java based logging framework
It is simple flexible, reliable and fast

It is configured through configuration files like xml or properties

It has three principal components

1. Loggers
2. Appenders
3. Layout

Loggers: It is responsible for logging information. To implement loggers into a project following steps need to be performed -

Create an instance for logger class: Logger class is a Java-based utility that has got all the generic methods already implemented to use log4j

Define the Log4j level: Primarily there are five kinds of log levels

All - This level of logging will log everything ( it turns all the logs on )
DEBUG – print the debugging information and is helpful in development stage
INFO – print informational message that highlights the progress of the application
WARN – print information regarding faulty and unexpected system behavior.
ERROR – print error message that might allow system to continue
FATAL – print system critical information which are causing the application to crash
OFF – No logging

Appenders: It is used to deliver LogEvents to their destination. It decides what will happen with log information. In simple words, it is used to write the logs in file. 

Following are few types of Appenders

ConsoleAppender: logs to standard output
File appender: prints logs to some file
Rolling file appender: to a file with maximum size
Note: In log4j properties we can call appender with any name. There are other appenders as well but we will restrict to these few.


Layouts: It is responsible for formatting logging information in different styles.
